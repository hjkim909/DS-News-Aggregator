This might not sound all that groundbreaking but when you consider that 90% of data processing and data entry jobs worldwide exist for this exact reason, it’s quite a revolutionary feature that went somewhat unnoticed.Have you ever found yourselfbeggingGPT (3.5 or 4) to spit out the answer you want and absolutely nothing else? No “Sure, here is your…” or any other useless fluff surrounding the core answer. GPT Functions are the solution you’ve been looking for.How are Functions meant to work?OpenAI’s docs on function calling are extremely limited. You’ll find yourself digging through their developer forum for examples of how to use them. I dug around the forum for you and have many example coming up.Here’s one of the only examples you’ll be able to find in their docs:functions = [{\"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\",\"properties\": {\"location\": {\"type\": \"string\",\"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\",},\"unit\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]},},\"required\": [\"location\"],},}]A function definition is a rigid JSON format that defines a function name, description and parameters. In this case, the function is meant to get the current weather. Obviously GPT isn’t able to call this actual API (since it doesn’t exist) but using this structured response you’d be able to connect the real API hypothetically.At a high level however, functions provide two layers of inference:Picking the function itself:You may notice that functions are passed into the OpenAI API call as an array. The reason you provide a name and description to each function are so GPT can decide which to use based on a given prompt. Providing multiple functions in your API call is like giving GPT a Swiss army knife and asking it to cut a piece of wood in half. It knows that even though it has a pair of pliers, scissors and a knife, it should use the saw!Function definitions contribute towards your token count. Passing in hundreds of functions would not only take up the majority of your token limit but also result in a drop in response quality. I often don’t even use this feature a",

They’re the best at packaging, selling, and delivering it consistently.If your plan to scale is simply “be better,” you’re setting yourself up for frustration.3. Refusing to let go of controlThis one stung.I believed no one could design exactly the way I wanted. No one could communicate with clients like I could. No one could match my standards.So I clung to everything. Every project, every pixel, every email.The result? I became my own bottleneck",

      "content": "News Comments 1 Intel has officially expanded its professional GPU portfolio with the launch of the Arc Pro B50, designed specifically for small-form-factor workstations. The card is based on the Battlemage BMG-G21 GPU, configured with 16 Xe2 cores. It comes paired with 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM clocked at 14 Gbps on a 128-bit memory bus, producing 224 GB/s of effective bandwidth. This configuration ensures that the GPU cores are properly fed while maintaining a low overall power draw. Intel has kept the total board power at 70 W, enabling the card to run entirely from the PCIe slot without external connectors. With a PCIe Gen 5 x8 interface, the Pro B50 balances efficiency and bandwidth for professional workloads. One of the key features of the Arc Pro B50 is its suitability for AI workloads and specialized professional applications. Intel claims performance of up to 170 TOPS in INT8 compute, which is significant for local AI inference tasks, machine learning workloads, and data preprocessing. Beyond AI, the GPU is optimized for CAD, engineering, architectural visualization, and design software, where stability is just as important as raw throughput. To meet these needs, Intel supplies a certified workstation driver stack, ensuring predictable performance across industry-standard applications.

The card is based on the Battlemage BMG-G21 GPU, configured with 16 Xe2 cores. It comes paired with 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM clocked at 14 Gbps on a 128-bit memory bus, producing 224 GB/s of effective bandwidth. This configuration ensures that the GPU cores are properly fed while maintaining a low overall power draw. Intel has kept the total board power at 70 W, enabling the card to run entirely from the PCIe slot without external connectors. With a PCIe Gen 5 x8 interface, the Pro B50 balances efficiency and bandwidth for professional workloads. One of the key features of the Arc Pro B50 is its suitability for AI workloads and specialized professional applications. Intel claims performance of up to 170 TOPS in INT8 compute, which is significant for local AI inference tasks, machine learning workloads, and data preprocessing. Beyond AI, the GPU is optimized for CAD, engineering, architectural visualization, and design software, where stability is just as important as raw throughput. To meet these needs, Intel supplies a certified workstation driver stack, ensuring predictable performance across industry-standard applications. The physical design reflects its target environment: the card uses a low-profile dual-slot form factor, making it ideal for dense workstation cases that prioritize both space savings and air",

The “container” dimension What does it mean for a space to have a certain number of dimensions? Informally, we could say that a dimension is an independent axis along which we can position a geometric object. In one-dimensional space, a point can only be moved along a single path. In 2D, we typically talk of two orthogonal axes, x and y. In three dimensions, we have x, y , and z. There’s more nuance to certain exotic or stripped-down (topological) spaces, but we don’t need to go into any of that. The definition lends itself to a simple, common-sense way to classify the dimensionality of geometric shapes: we can look at the minimum number of spatial dimensions required to contain the object in question.

Recently, at Sovrn , we had an AI Hackathon where we were encouraged to experiment with anything related to machine learning. The Hackathon yielded some fantastic projects from across the company. Everything from SQL query generators to chatbots that can answer questions about our products and other incredible work. I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn more about Apple’s ML tools and maybe even build something with real business value. A few of my colleagues and I teamed up to play with CreateML and CoreML to see if we could integrate some ML functionality into our iOS app. We got a model trained and integrated into our app in several hours, which was pretty amazing. But we quickly realized that we had a few problems to solve before we could actually ship this thing. The model was hefty. It was about 50MB. That’s a lot of space to take up in our app bundle. We wanted to update the model without releasing a new app version. We wanted to use the model in the web browser as well. We didn’t have time to solve all of these problems.

Recently, at Sovrn , we had an AI Hackathon where we were encouraged to experiment with anything related to machine learning. The Hackathon yielded some fantastic projects from across the company. Everything from SQL query generators to chatbots that can answer questions about our products and other incredible work. I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn more about Apple’s ML tools and maybe even build something with real business value. A few of my colleagues and I teamed up to play with CreateML and CoreML to see if we could integrate some ML functionality into our iOS app. We got a model trained and integrated into our app in several hours, which was pretty amazing. But we quickly realized that we had a few problems to solve before we could actually ship this thing. The model was hefty. It was about 50MB. That’s a lot of space to take up in our app bundle. We wanted to update the model without releasing a new app version. We wanted to use the model in the web browser as well. We didn’t have time to solve all of these problems.

      "summary": "이 글은 CoreML 모델을 서버에 배포하기 위한 방법을 Vapor 웹 프레임워크를 활용하여 제시합니다. iOS 앱에 CoreML 모델을 통합하려다 겪었던 문제점(모델 크기, 업데이트, 웹에서의 사용 필요성)을 해결하고자 서버 측 배포를 고려하게 된 배경을 설명합니다. 저자는 Vapor를 통해 CoreML 모델을 서버에 배포하여 모델 관리, 업데이트, 다양한 플랫폼에서의 접근성 문제를 해결하는 방안을 모색할 수 있다고 결론짓습니다.",
